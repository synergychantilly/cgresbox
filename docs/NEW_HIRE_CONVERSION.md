# New Hire Conversion System

## Overview

The New Hire Conversion System automatically converts new hire profiles to active user accounts when they register with the same email. This seamless transition ensures that:

1. **No data is lost** - All completed documents are transferred
2. **User experience is smooth** - They don't need to redo completed work
3. **Admin tracking is maintained** - Full audit trail of the conversion

## How It Works

### 1. New Hire Registration
- Admins add new hires to the system before they have active accounts
- New hires can access documents and complete them using temporary sessions
- Document progress is tracked under their new hire profile

### 2. User Account Creation
When a user registers with an email that matches a new hire:

1. **Email/Name Matching**: The system checks for matching new hires using:
   - Email pattern matching (firstName.lastName@domain)
   - Exact name matching
   - Partial name matching with confidence scoring

2. **Data Transfer**: If a match is found:
   - All completed documents are transferred to the new user account
   - Document statuses (viewed, started, completed) are preserved
   - DocuSeal submission data is maintained
   - Completion timestamps and URLs are transferred

3. **Profile Enhancement**: The user profile is updated with:
   - Occupation from new hire record
   - Conversion tracking fields
   - Original new hire reference

4. **Cleanup**: The original new hire record is:
   - Deactivated (soft delete)
   - Marked as converted
   - Preserved for audit purposes

## Technical Implementation

### Core Services

#### `newHireConversionService.ts`
- `convertNewHireToActiveUser()` - Main conversion function
- `getNewHireConversionHistory()` - Admin reporting
- Matching algorithms for email and name patterns

#### `AuthContext.tsx` 
- Modified registration flow to trigger conversion check
- Automatic conversion during user signup

#### Database Changes

**User Model Extensions:**
```typescript
interface User {
  // ... existing fields
  occupation?: string;
  convertedFromNewHire?: boolean;
  originalNewHireId?: string;
  originalNewHireName?: string;
  conversionDate?: Date;
}
```

**UserDocumentStatus Extensions:**
```typescript
interface UserDocumentStatus {
  // ... existing fields
  convertedFromNewHire?: boolean;
  originalNewHireId?: string;
  originalNewHireName?: string;
}
```

### Matching Logic

The system uses a multi-step matching process:

1. **Exact Match**: First name + Last name exact match
2. **Email Pattern**: Extract names from email (john.doe@company.com)
3. **Partial Match**: Last name match with confidence scoring
4. **ZIP Code Verification**: Additional verification when available

### Error Handling

- **No Match Found**: Registration proceeds normally
- **Multiple Matches**: Conversion skipped, requires manual review
- **Conversion Failure**: Registration still succeeds, conversion logged for retry
- **Partial Failures**: Document transfer errors don't block user creation

## Admin Interface

### New Hire Conversions Dashboard

Accessible via the admin panel, provides:

- **Conversion History**: Complete list of all conversions
- **Statistics**: Monthly conversion counts and success rates
- **Details**: Original new hire info, transferred documents count
- **Audit Trail**: Timestamps and conversion metadata

### Features:
- Real-time refresh of conversion data
- Export capabilities for reporting
- Detailed conversion metadata
- Error tracking and resolution

## Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Perfect Match
1. Admin adds "John Doe" as new hire
2. John completes 3 documents as new hire
3. John registers with john.doe@company.com
4. System matches and transfers all 3 documents
5. John's account shows completed documents immediately

### Scenario 2: Email Pattern Match
1. New hire: "Sarah Johnson"
2. Registers with: sarah.johnson@company.com
3. System extracts "sarah" and "johnson" from email
4. Matches with new hire record
5. Automatic conversion with high confidence

### Scenario 3: Name Variation
1. New hire: "Robert Smith"
2. Registers as: "Bob Smith"
3. Last name matches, first name differs
4. System creates medium confidence match
5. Conversion proceeds with audit log notation

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Logging

All conversion attempts are logged with:
- Source new hire information
- Target user account details
- Match confidence level
- Documents transferred count
- Any errors or warnings

### Common Issues

1. **Multiple Matches**: Manual admin review required
2. **Document Transfer Failures**: Individual document issues logged
3. **Profile Update Errors**: User creation succeeds, profile enhancement fails

### Resolution Steps

1. Check conversion logs in admin dashboard
2. Verify new hire data accuracy
3. Manual document transfer if needed
4. Update user profile manually if required

## Best Practices

### For Admins
- Use consistent naming when adding new hires
- Include ZIP codes for better matching
- Monitor conversion dashboard regularly
- Review failed conversions promptly

### For Development
- Always handle conversion failures gracefully
- Log detailed information for debugging
- Preserve data integrity during transfers
- Maintain audit trails for compliance

## Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: Only transfer documents between verified matches
- **Access Control**: Conversion functions restricted to authenticated users
- **Audit Compliance**: Full conversion history maintained
- **Error Logging**: Sensitive data excluded from logs

## Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning**: Improve matching accuracy with ML algorithms
- **Bulk Operations**: Admin tools for bulk conversions
- **Integration APIs**: External system integration for HR workflows
- **Advanced Reporting**: Detailed analytics and reporting features
